# Introduction

In this project, I collect 12,000+ violent incidents from a Chinese social media platform, Weibo (weibo.com), using relevant keywords.

We integrateed Generative AI (GPT-4o) and human comprehension for data labeling and categorization. The workflow proceedsed as follows: 
1) We manually reviewed a randomly selected sample of Weibo posts to understand their content and structure.
2) We engineered prompts for the GPT-4o to extract key information from the posts.
3) Using the extracted information, we manually createed categories and labels tailored to the data.
4) We designed prompts for GPT-4o to label the posts across five dimensions: dispute areas, specific issues, identities of violent service procurers, regions, and types of violent actions.
5) We collaborateed with undergraduate research assistants to thoroughly verify and calibrate the AI-generated labels, ensuring accuracy and reliability of the results

We integrate Weibo data with violent incident data from other sources and provincial-level information.

The goal of this project is to understand regional variations of numbers of violent incidents -- why there are more violent incidents in some provinces than others?

This project is in collaboration with Professor Lynette Ong (https://www.lynetteong.com/).
